# Instant Preview

https://www.instantpreview.dev/ is a web service for instant preview of html files or websites.

It's like Netlify or Vercel or Cloudflare Pages but without the hassle. No accounts, no projects, just drag&drop
files or upload them using api.

It's not a website hosting service. The files will be deleted after ~2 hrs.

It's meant for previewing websites during development.
